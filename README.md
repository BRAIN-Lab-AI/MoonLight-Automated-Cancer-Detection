# Moonlight: Enhanced Deep Learning Models for Breast Cancer Detection Using Histopathology Images

## Introduction

**Moonlight** is an advanced deep learning framework designed to improve the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of breast cancer diagnosis from histopathological images. The project introduces modular CNN architectures, novel loss functions, enhanced data augmentation strategies, and explainability features through Grad-CAM++. 

Moonlight aims to support AI-assisted diagnostics with clinically relevant outcomes and provides researchers with a configurable pipeline for experimentation using the BreaKHis dataset.

## Project Technicalities

### Terminologies
- **Diffusion Model:** A generative model that progressively transforms random noise into coherent data.
- **Latent Space:** A compressed, abstract representation of data where complex features are captured.
- **UNet Architecture:** A neural network with an encoder-decoder structure featuring skip connections for better feature preservation.
- **Text Encoder:** A model that converts text into numerical embeddings for downstream tasks.
- **Perceptual Loss:** A loss function that measures high-level differences between images, emphasizing perceptual similarity.
- **Tokenization:** The process of breaking down text into smaller units (tokens) for processing.
- **Noise Vector:** A randomly generated vector used to initialize the diffusion process in generative models.
- **Decoder:** A network component that transforms latent representations back into image space.
- **Iterative Refinement:** The process of gradually improving the quality of generated data through multiple steps.
- **Conditional Generation:** The process where outputs are generated based on auxiliary inputs, such as textual descriptions.

### Problem Statements
- **Problem 1:** Achieving high-resolution and detailed images using conventional diffusion models remains challenging.
- **Problem 2:** Existing models suffer from slow inference times during the image generation process.
- **Problem 3:** There is limited capability in performing style transfer and generating diverse artistic variations.

### Loopholes or Research Areas
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Lack of robust metrics to effectively assess the quality of generated images.
- **Output Consistency:** Inconsistencies in output quality when scaling the model to higher resolutions.
- **Computational Resources:** Training requires significant GPU compute resources, which may not be readily accessible.

### Problem vs. Ideation: Proposed 3 Ideas to Solve the Problems
1. **Optimized Architecture:** Redesign the model architecture to improve efficiency and balance image quality with faster inference.
2. **Advanced Loss Functions:** Integrate novel loss functions (e.g., perceptual loss) to better capture artistic nuances and structural details.
3. **Enhanced Data Augmentation:** Implement sophisticated data augmentation strategies to improve the modelâ€™s robustness and reduce overfitting.

### Proposed Solution: Code-Based Implementation
This repository provides an implementation of the enhanced stable diffusion model using PyTorch. The solution includes:

- **Modified UNet Architecture:** Incorporates residual connections and efficient convolutional blocks.
- **Novel Loss Functions:** Combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) with perceptual loss to enhance feature learning.
- **Optimized Training Loop:** Reduces computational overhead while maintaining performance.

### Key Components
- **`model.py`**: Contains the modified UNet architecture and other model components.
- **`train.py`**: Script to handle the training process with configurable parameters.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions for data processing, augmentation, and metric evaluations.
- **`inference.py`**: Script for generating images using the trained model.

## Model Workflow
The workflow of the Enhanced Stable Diffusion model is designed to translate textual descriptions into high-quality artistic images through a multi-step diffusion process:

1. **Input:**
   - **Text Prompt:** The model takes a text prompt (e.g., "A surreal landscape with mountains and rivers") as the primary input.
   - **Tokenization:** The text prompt is tokenized and processed through a text encoder (such as a CLIP model) to obtain meaningful embeddings.
   - **Latent Noise:** A random latent noise vector is generated to initialize the diffusion process, which is then conditioned on the text embeddings.

2. **Diffusion Process:**
   - **Iterative Refinement:** The conditioned latent vector is fed into a modified UNet architecture. The model iteratively refines this vector by reversing a diffusion process, gradually reducing noise while preserving the text-conditioned features.
   - **Intermediate States:** At each step, intermediate latent representations are produced that increasingly capture the structure and details dictated by the text prompt.

3. **Output:**
   - **Decoding:** The final refined latent representation is passed through a decoder (often part of a Variational Autoencoder setup) to generate the final image.
   - **Generated Image:** The output is a synthesized image that visually represents the input text prompt, complete with artistic style and detail.
